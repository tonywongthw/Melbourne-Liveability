Apart from the "data" folder, other folders/files are used to build react frontend.

Run frontend under node environment:

1. cd to "React frontend" folder, make sure it contains package.json
2. run npm install
3. run npm start, then a web page will pop out.

note: the data for drawing the frontend chart in "chart1.js" is hardcoded. Original data is downloaded from AURIN and using python to output a json file containing selected attributes, see data folder.
